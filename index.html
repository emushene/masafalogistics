                    <p><h5> As customs regulations strengthen each year, border crossings become increasingly difficult and the risk of significant delays at the border increases. We have the expertise necessary to avoid such delays and smoothly transition your freight from South Africa to Kenya and from Kenya to South Africa. We can simplify border crossing to one single phone call, providing you with a single point of contact, a single service, a single bill, and the assurance that your freight will arrive on-time and intact.
